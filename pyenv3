# (The below instructions are intended for common
# shell setups. See the README for more guidance
# if they don't apply and/or don't work for you.)

# Add pyenv executable to PATH and
# enable shims by adding the following
# to ~/.profile:

export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"

# If your ~/.profile sources ~/.bashrc,
# the lines need to be inserted before the part
# that does that. See the README for another option.

# If you have ~/.bash_profile, make sure that it
# also executes the above lines -- e.g. by
# copying them there or by sourcing ~/.profile

# Load pyenv into the shell by adding
# the following to ~/.bashrc:

eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Make sure to restart your entire logon session
# for changes to profile files to take effect.
