These are various bash shell code snippets pulled in by ~/.bashrc.

1. The shell iterators over ~/sh (and a few subdirs), sourcing files as needed.
2. Makes it very easy to update shell environment - just drop in a new snippet in "${HOME}/sh/directory".


The modeline for each of these should be something like -
1. # vim:ts=4:sts=4:ai:et:syntax=bash:ft=bash:


Obviously that doesn't apply to this file :)

# vim:ts=4:sts=4:ai:et:syntax=markdown:ft=markdown:
